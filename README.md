# Job-Application--website
 I created a job application site clone using HTML and CSS. The goal was to mimic the design and layout of a typical job application platform. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface with a clean and professional design. While it's a clone, I aimed to capture the essential functionalities of a job application platform.
